# Arc Length and Curvature

This is an un-revised verison. I will add more and fix typos after office hours.

## Arc Length

For a curve, if we want to find the length from $P_1$ to $P_2$, we use the length of straight lines at many points along the line and add them all up.

So, we want the integral of the length from $\vec r(t)$ to $\vec r(t + h)$ as $h \to 0$. So:

$$\int\limits_a^b \sqrt{\left({dx\over du}\right)^2 + \left({dy\over du}\right)^2 + \left({dz\over du}\right)^2}du$$
$$Or$$
$$\int\limits_a^b \sqrt{\left(f'(t)\right)^2 + \left(g'(t)\right)^2 + \left(h'(t)\right)^2}du$$

### Formal Definition:

So, given $\vec r_i$ at $r(t_i)$, and $\vec r_{i + 1}$ at $r(t_{i + 1})$,

$$\sum_{i = 0}^N | \vec r_{i+1} - \vec r_i| = \sum_{i = 0}^N {|\vec r(t_i + \Delta t_i) - \vec r(t_i)| \over \Delta t_i} \Delta t_i$$

$$ \downarrow \Delta t_i \to 0 $$

$$\sum_{i = 0}^N |\vec r(t_i)|'\Delta t_i \rightarrow \int\limits_{t_i}^{t_{N + 1}} |\vec r(u)|'du$$

$$=$$

$$\int_a^b \sqrt{(dx/du)^2 + (dy/du)^2 + (dz/du)^2}du$$

If the curve C is parameterized according to r(t) = <f(t), g(t), h(t)> then for t=a & t= b, a < b the length of the arc on C that is in between the points is

$$\int_a^b|\vec r'(u)|du = \int_a^b \sqrt{(dx/du)^2 + (dy/du)^2 + (dz/du)^2}du$$

### Relation to 2D

Let $y = f(x)$ for the curve C

$$
\begin{cases}
  x = t \\
  y = f(t) \\
  z = 0
\end{cases}
$$

$$\int_a^b \sqrt{(t')^2 + (f')^2 + (0)^2}$$
$$\int_a^b \sqrt{1 + (f'(t))^2}$$

### Question 1

Curve C = $\vec r(t) = \cos(t)i + \sin(t)j + tk$
Find the length of arc on C from $(1,0,0)$ to $(1,0,2\pi)$

#### Solution

The start point is at $\vec r(0)$ and the end is $\vec r (2\pi)$

$$L = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{(\cos'(u))^2 + (\sin'(u))^2 + (u')^2}du$$

$$L = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{(-\sin(u))^2 + (\cos(u))^2 + 1}du$$

$$L = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{1 + 1}du = \sqrt{2} \rvert_0^{2\pi} = \sqrt{2} * 0 + \sqrt{2} * 2\pi$$

## Arc Length Function

A function that gives the length from $t = 0$ to $t$, denoted by $L = s(t)$

$$ s(t) = \int\limits_0^t |\vec r'(u)|du $$

### Property

$$ {ds\over dt} = |\vec r'(t)| $$

### How I understand it:

For some uses, it is a good idea to make the function of the curve use the length as a parameter instead of $t$. This means that instead of $\vec r(t)$ we are using $\vec r_0(s)$, where $s$ is the length of the arc.

To get that function, we need a way to get from $\vec r(t)$ to $\vec r_0(s)$. The best way to do this is to define $t$ in terms of $s$ and plug that into $\vec r(t)$. So, we a re looking for $t(s)$. Since we already have a function $s(t)$ (the length function), we can take the inverse to get $t(s)$.

$$ t(s) = s^{-1}(t) $$

Then, we plug that into $\vec r(t)$ to get the new function.

$$ \vec r_0(s) = \vec r(t(s)) $$

This function is useful because it can change the domain of the function, so you could get rid of some limits on $t$ (e.g. if $f(t) = ln(t)$ or something). 

He said it also has the properties of the curve but not the velocity or something?

will be in exam

### How he explained it:

We want to find a parametrization $\vec r_0(s)$ so that the "travel speed" with respect to $\vec r_0(s)$vis constant & is = to 1

$$\int_a^b |\vec r'(u)|du = b - a$$
$$\downdownarrows$$
$$|\vec r_0'(u) = 1|$$

<!--if 
$$s_1 = \int_0^{t_1} |r'(u)|dt$$

$$s_0 = \int_0^{t_0} |r'(u)|dt$$-->

then $\int_0^s |\vec r_0'(u)| du = s$
One can define $\vec r_0(s) = \vec r(t(s))$

$$s(t) = f(t) = \int_0^{t} |u'(t)|dt$$

$$t(s) = f^{-1}(s)$$

### Question 2

$\vec r(t) = \cos(t)i + \sin(t)j + tk$
Reparameterize it with respect to arc length measured from (1,0,0) in the direction ofincreasing t.

#### Solution

The start point is (1,0,0), and the direction is +t

Find $s(t)$:

$$s(t) = \int_0^t |\vec r'(u)|du = \sqrt{2}t$$
find the inverse (t(s))
$$t(s) = {s\over\sqrt{2}} \to \vec r_0(s) = \vec r(t(s))$$
$$ = \cos({s\over\sqrt{2}})\hat i + \sin({s\over\sqrt{2}})\hat j + s/\sqrt{2}\hat k$$
