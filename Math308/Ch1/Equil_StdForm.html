# Standard form

For linear, first-order equations, we can display the euqation as the general form:

$$y' + p(t)y = g(t)$$

The useful thing with these problems is that we can manipulate it to get a product rule, then integrate.

$$f(t)y' + f(t)p(t)y = f(t)g(t)$$

Where $f'(t) = f(t)p(t)$

This $f(t)$ can be found by following a strategy mentioned previously:

$$f'(t) = f(t)p(t)$$
$${f'(t)\over f(t)} = p(t)$$
$$\int {f'(t)\over f(t)}dt = \int p(t)dt$$
$$ln|f(t)| = \int p(t)dt$$
$$f(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}$$

Question 1:
Solve the differential equation

$$\cos(t)y' - \sin(t)y = t^2$$ 

If you notice that the left side follows the pattern:

$$f(t)y' - f'(t)y$$

We can use the product rule to find:

$$y\cos(t) = \int t^2dt$$ 
$$y\cos(t) = \frac{1}{3} t^3 + C$$ 
$$y = {\frac{1}{3} t^3 + C\over \cos(t)}$$ 

One note is that this solution is only valid when $\cos(t) \ne 0$

Question 2:
Solve the differential equation

$$y' - 2ty = t$$ 

Here, we do not have a normal product rule, but we can manipulate it to get a product rule.

In this case, we can multiply both sides by $e^{-t^2}$ to get a product rule:

$$e^{-t^2}y' - 2te^{-t^2}y = te^{-t^2}$$ 
$$ye^{-t^2} = -\frac{1}{2}e^{-t^2} + C$$
$$y = Ce^{t^2-\frac{1}{2}}$$
