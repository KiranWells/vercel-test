# Differential Form

we can also write differential equations like this:

$$\frac{dx}{dy} = f(x,y)$$
$$M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$$

If $Mdx + Ndy = d\psi$, meaning that this is the solution to some equation $\psi(x,y)$, which since $d\psi = 0$, will be constant. So, we can try to find that equation using the properties of partial derivatives:

$$d\psi = \psi_xdx+\psi_ydy = Mdx + Ndy$$

If this equation hold true, this is called an exact equation. We can determine if this is true by using another formula of partial derivatives:

For some $f(x,y)$, $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$, which means that we can take the derivative with respect to the opposite variable and check if they are the same. For example:

$$(2x + y)dx + (2y + x)dy = 0$$

We can validate that this is exact by taking the partial derivative of each side with respect to the opposite variable:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (2x + y) = 1$$
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (2y + x) = 1$$

And when integrating, we can find the function $\psi$:

$$x^2 + y^2 + xy$$
