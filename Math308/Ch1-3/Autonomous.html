Using an autonomous equation:

$$y' = f(y)$$

We assume $f$ is continuous (for this document). We can find an equilibrium solution by setting $y' = 0$:

$$y' = 0 = f{\bar y}$$

The equation is alwas separable, so the solution is either an equiibrium solution, or it can be integrated:

$$\int \frac{dy}{f(y)} = t + C$$

We can find the time it takes for a solution to start from one y-value and get to another.

$$t_2 - t_1 = \Delta t = \int\limits_{y1}^{y2} \frac{dy}{f(y)}$$

Specifically, it may take an infinite amount of time. This means that there is a horizontal asymptote, as it never reaches the new value. If it can reach an infinite value in a finite time, we can find a vertical asymptote:

(Remember that an improper integral is an integral to $\pm \inf$)

$$\int_{y_0}^{\inf} {dy\over f(y)} = t_1 - t_0$$

If this integral converges, we have a vertical asymptote, as it will reach inf.

!!Example 1

$$y' = y^2,y(0) = 1$$

So, if this has a vertical asymptote, we can find a time to reach infinity:

$$\int\limits_0^{\tau}dt = \int\limits_1^{\inf} \frac{dy}{y^2}$$

Remember from calculus that if $p \gt 1$, it will converge, so this will converge, meaning there is a vertical asymptote.

However, with an equation $y' = \sqrt{y}$, it will diverge, so there is no asymptote.

An equilibrium solution is called stable if solutions approach that equilibrium, and unstable if solutions move away from it. Semistable equilibriums are stable from only one side.

If we graph $y'$ as a function of $y$, we can take the horizontal axis, and that will show all of the equilibrium solutions. Then, we can see if they are stable by cheking nearb
