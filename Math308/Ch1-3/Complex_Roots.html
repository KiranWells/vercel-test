# Complex roots of the Characteristic Equation 

Remember that for en equation

$$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$

Where $a,b,c$ are constants, we can find a solution with the substitution $y = e^{rt}$:

$$ar^2 + br + c = 0$$

Originally, we could only use *real* solutions, but here we will consider *complex* solutions of the form:

$$r_1 = \alpha + i\beta, r_2 = \alpha - i\beta$$
$$r = \alpha \pm i\beta$$

Where:

$$\alpha = -\frac{b}{2a}$$
$$\beta = {\sqrt{4ac - b^2} \over 2a}$$

Euler's formula explains a realtionship between real and complex numbers:

$$e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i\sin \theta$$

This shows that: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
