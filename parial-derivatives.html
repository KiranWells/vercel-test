## Functions of multiple varibles

A function is a map from one set of numbers to another set. In a function, there is only one result per source. We have also demonstrated functions that go from a set of real numbers to a set of vectors.

In a multivariable function, set two is a set of real numbers, and set one is a set of _pairs_ of real numbers.

**Examples:**
$$f(x,y) = x+y$$
$$f(1,-1) = 0$$
$$f(1,\sqrt{2}) = 1 + \sqrt{2}$$

---

$$f(x,y) = x = x + 0y$$
In this, y has no effect, and is called a fictive variable.

---

$$f(x,y) = {1\over{x - y}}$$
Domain: $(x_0,y_0) \in D$ means $f(x,y)$ is defined at $(x_0,y_0)$

The domain of this is $D = \left\{(x,y) | x\ne y\right\}$

### Question 1:

For each of the functions, evaluate f(3,2) and find and sketch domain:

1. $f(x,y) = {\sqrt{x + y + 1}\over x - 1}$
   - Solution:
     $$ $$
     Domain: $\begin{cases}x - 1 \ne 0 \iff x\ne 1\\x + y +1 \ge 0 \iff y \ge -x-1\end{cases}$

1. $f(x,y) = x\ln(y^2 - x)$
   - Solution:
     $$f(3,2) = 3\ln(2^2 -3)=3\ln(1)=0$$
     $$D = \{(x,y)|y^2>x\}$$

### Question 4

Find the domain and range of $g(x,y) = \sqrt{9 - x^2 - y^2}$

#### Solution

Domain:
$$D = \{(x,y)|9 - x^2 - y^2 \ge 0\}$$
$$D = \{(x,y)|x^2 + y^2 \le 9\}$$

Range:
The point $z$ is in the range of $g(x,y)$ if there exists $x,y$ such that $z = \sqrt{9 - x^2 - y^2}$
$$z \ge 0, z \le 3$$
For any value $z \in (0,3)$ there exists $x$ such that $z = \sqrt{9 - x^2 - y^2}$\
Therefore, the range of $g(x,y)$ is the interval $[0,3]$
