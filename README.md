# Math 251 Notes

This site is deployed on Vercel [here](https://math-251-notes.now.sh/), and is a way to share and display formatted math notes for the class MATH 251. If you want to add a file or suggest changes, feel free to fork the project or create an issue. 

All files are created using Markdown and LaTex syntax, and rendered using [TeXMe](https://github.com/susam/texme). To add a file, just save the markdown it as `.html` and add:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/texme@0.7.0"></script>
```
to the bottom.
